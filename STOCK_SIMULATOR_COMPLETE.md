## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Loading
**Issue:** Stocks not appearing  
**Solution:** 
```bash
cd backend
node index.js
```
Wait for "Server ready for requests" message

### Yahoo Finance Rate Limiting
**Issue:** Some stocks fail to load  
**Solution:** Backend automatically retries and caches successful requests

### Slow Initial Load
**Issue:** First load takes 30-60 seconds  
**Solution:** Normal behavior - backend is fetching 1,600+ stocks. Subsequent loads use cache.
