# Dark Mode Implementation

## Overview
Fully functional dark mode has been implemented across all pages with an electric blue (#00d4ff) accent color scheme.

## Features

### Color Scheme
- **Background**: Dark grey (#1a1a1a to #0d0d0d gradient)
- **Cards**: #2a2a2a
- **Accent**: Electric Blue (#00d4ff)
- **Text**: Light grey (#e5e5e5)
- **Borders**: Electric blue with glow effect

### Visual Effects
- Electric blue outlines on all cards and buttons
- Subtle glow effects (box-shadow) for better contrast
- Enhanced hover states with increased glow
- Toggle switches with blue glow when active in dark mode

### How It Works

1. **Toggle Dark Mode**:
   - Go to Profile â†’ Settings
   - Toggle the "Dark Mode" switch under Display settings
   - The setting is saved to localStorage and persists across page loads

2. **Automatic Application**:
   - Dark mode preference is loaded immediately when any page opens
   - No flash of light mode on page load
   - Setting applies to all pages in the app

### Technical Details

- **Storage**: Uses `localStorage.getItem('darkMode')`
- **CSS Classes**: Adds `dark-mode` class to `<body>` element
- **Variables**: Uses CSS custom properties for easy theming
- **Coverage**: All 26+ HTML pages include dark mode support

### Files Modified

1. **styles.css**: Added dark mode variables and styles
2. **settings.html**: Added dark mode toggle with JavaScript
3. All HTML pages: Added dark mode initialization scripts

## UI Improvements

### Removed Redundant Headers
- **Settings**: Removed large header card, starts directly with settings sections
- **Friends**: Removed header card, starts with action buttons
- **Subscription**: Removed header card, shows pricing tiers immediately

This creates a cleaner, more efficient use of screen space.

## Testing

1. Open `settings.html` in your browser
2. Toggle the Dark Mode switch
3. Navigate to other pages to see dark mode persist
4. Toggle off to return to light mode
