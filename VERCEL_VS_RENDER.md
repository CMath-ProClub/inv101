# Vercel vs Render: Which Should You Use?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitations with Vercel

### Vercel's Serverless Architecture Issues:

1. **10-second timeout limit** (free tier)
   - Your stock cache loads 1,615 tickers in ~3-5 minutes
   - Vercel will kill the process after 10 seconds
   - Stock cache won't fully initialize

2. **No persistent processes**
   - Each request runs in isolation
   - Background jobs (scheduled refreshes) won't work
   - Stock cache needs to reload on every request (impossible)

3. **Cold starts**
   - Every request after inactivity starts fresh
   - 3-5 minute cache load on EVERY cold start
   - Very slow user experience

4. **Memory limits**
   - Free tier: 1024 MB
   - Your app with 1,615 stocks may exceed this

## ‚úÖ Render is Better for Your App

### Why Render Works Well:

1. **Persistent server process**
   - Stock cache loads once, stays in memory
   - Background jobs work perfectly
   - Scheduled refreshes every 6 hours

2. **No timeout limits**
   - Cache can take full 3-5 minutes to initialize
   - Long-running processes supported

3. **Simple deployment**
   - Works exactly like your local setup
   - No code changes needed

4. **Free tier is generous**
   - 750 hours/month web service
   - Enough for your needs

## üéØ Recommendation: Use Render

**Render is the right choice for your backend.**

Your app needs:
- ‚úÖ Long initialization time (stock cache)
- ‚úÖ Background scheduled jobs
- ‚úÖ Persistent in-memory cache
- ‚úÖ Long-running processes

All of these work on Render but NOT on Vercel.

## üí° Alternative: Hybrid Approach

If you really want to use Vercel, you could:

1. **Deploy frontend to Vercel**
   - Host `prototype/` folder on Vercel
   - Fast, global CDN
   - Perfect for static HTML/CSS/JS

2. **Deploy backend to Render**
   - API server with stock data
   - MongoDB connection
   - Background jobs

3. **Connect them**
   - Frontend calls Render API
   - `https://inv101.onrender.com/api/...`

But this adds complexity. For simplicity, **just use Render for everything**.
