# Security & Automation Improvements

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. üóëÔ∏è Cleaned Up Unnecessary Documentation
Removed **20 redundant markdown files** that were cluttering the repository:

**Root directory:**
- CALCULATOR_TESTING_GUIDE.md
- FRONTEND_UPDATE_GUIDE.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md
- RESPONSIVE_DESIGN_SUMMARY.md
- STOCK_ANALYSIS_FEATURES.md
- STOCK_ANALYSIS_UI_IMPROVEMENTS.md
- STOCK_SIMULATOR_COMPLETE.md

**Backend directory:**
- ARTICLE_CACHE_README.md
- README.md

**Prototype directory:**
- BUTTON_FUNCTIONALITY_REPORT.md
- CALCULATOR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- CALCULATOR_STATUS.md
- COMPACT_MODE_README.md
- DARK_MODE_README.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
- RESPONSIVE_DESIGN_GUIDE.md
- RESPONSIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- RESPONSIVE_VISUAL_GUIDE.md
- UPDATE_SUMMARY.md

**Files kept:** README.md, QUICKSTART.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md, DEPLOY_TO_RENDER.md (essential documentation)

### 2. üîí Enhanced Security

#### Updated .gitignore
Added comprehensive protection for sensitive files:
```gitignore
# Environment files
backend/.env
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
.env.local
.env.production

# Sensitive data
*.pem
*.key
*.cert
.secrets
```

#### Security Audit Results
‚úÖ **No hardcoded credentials found** in any files
‚úÖ All API keys properly use `process.env` variables
‚úÖ MongoDB connection string uses environment variable
‚úÖ `.env` file is NOT tracked in git (confirmed)
‚úÖ `.env.example` is safely tracked for reference

#### Protected Information
- MongoDB URI (MONGODB_URI)
- News API keys (NEWSAPI_KEY, THENEWSAPI_TOKEN, etc.)
- All other sensitive credentials stored in `.env` only

---

### 3. üåô Automated Midnight Scraper

#### New Scheduler Added
The API scrapers now run **automatically every day at midnight** without requiring any manual intervention.

**Implementation:**
- Added `startMidnightScraper()` method to `backend/scheduler.js`
- Enabled in `backend/index.js` with cron expression: `0 0 * * *`
- Runs completely independent of user presence

**Console Output:**
```
üìÖ Scheduling midnight scraper: 0 0 * * *
‚úÖ Midnight scraper scheduled successfully
üåô Scrapers will run automatically every day at midnight
```

#### Complete Scheduled Tasks
Your server now runs these automated tasks:

| Task | Schedule | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Midnight Scraper** | Daily at 00:00 | Fetch new articles from all sources |
| Article Refresh | Every 6 hours | Keep articles up-to-date |
| Stock Cache Refresh | Every 6 hours (3,9,15,21) | Update stock prices |
| Daily Cleanup | Daily at 02:00 | Remove articles older than 90 days |

## üöÄ How It Works

### Midnight Scraper Process
1. Server starts and initializes all scheduled tasks
2. At midnight every night, the scraper automatically:
   - Fetches articles from Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, CNBC, Reuters
   - Checks for duplicates
   - Saves new articles to MongoDB
   - Logs statistics (articles added, duplicates skipped, duration)
3. Continues running even if you're not present

### To Verify It's Working
Check your server logs the day after for entries like:
```
üåô Midnight scraper task triggered
‚è∞ Time: [timestamp]
‚úÖ Midnight scraper completed: {
  articlesAdded: X,
  duplicatesSkipped: Y,
  sources: Z,
  duration: Xs
}
```
